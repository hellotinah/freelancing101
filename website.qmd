This cheatsheet summarizes the contents of this [video](https://quarto.org): a step by step guide to starting a freelancing career.

## 🔍 Figure Out Your Unfair Advantage

::: {.callout}
💡 Unfair advantages are skills, experiences, or resources that give an individual a significant edge over others in achieving success or reaching their goals, often stemming from circumstances beyond their control or exclusive opportunities.

::: {.warning}
⚠️ Don't skip this step! It's extremely important for a long-lasting successful freelancing career.
:::
:::

Your unfair advantage could stem from:

::: {.emoji-list}
- 👔 Work experience
- 😊 Personality traits (e.g., compassion, attention to detail, patience)
- 🧠 Domain expertise (e.g., coding, drawing, woodworking)
- 📚 Learning ability

## 💼 Transform Your Unfair Advantage into a Marketable Skill

## 🐦 Two Birds One Stone: Portfolio and Your First Gig

::: {.callout}
💼 Portfolio is everything. Doesn't matter if you already have lots of work experience on your resume. 
:::

Think about these key questions:

::: {.emoji-list}
- 🤔 How do I showcase myself and my unfair advantage?
- 🎯 Based on the type of work I'm going for, how do I show that I have the skills and experience my potential client would want?
- ⏳ Spend a lot of time building your portfolio because that is almost always the first screen
:::

::: {.callout .tip}
💡 **Pro Tip:** Change your portfolio projects depending on the specific project you are trying to land. Clients will hire the freelancer with the most relevant experience.
:::

::: {.callout .warning}
⚠️ Don't just do personal projects by yourself! Go out and offer to work on real projects to put on your portfolio.
:::

```
## 🔧 Platforms

::: {.callout}
💼 I personally prefer not to use platforms like Fiverr and Upwork as a freelancer because margins are very thin and sometimes people can be difficult to work with. But they can be very beneficial!
:::


Consider using platforms if:

::: {.emoji-list}
🏞️ You have a completely blank portfolio. It's a good way to start building your portfolio.

🚀 You have a rare skill that is in high demand (e.g., building AI chatbots).

💰 You can undercut people's prices (e.g., building websites like this one using Quarto, which is way faster and cheaper).

🌍 You're from a developing country because generally developed country clients pay better than local clients.

🤝 You just want to expand your network.
:::

## 🌱 Sourcing Clients & Scaling

::: {.callout}
💼 Initially, you might need to work for free and handle challenging situations. The goal is to build a system that continuously attracts clients, allowing you to be selective.
:::

    E --> H[Attend Events]
    E --> I[Post Content]
    F & G & H & I --> J[Selective Clientele]
```
Key Strategies:
::: {.emoji-list}

🤝 Manage Current Relationships

Deliver excellent work
Foster repeat business
Encourage referrals


📢 Outreach

🎭 Attend industry events (e.g., content creator meetups)
🖋️ Post educational content online (especially on LinkedIn)
:::


::: {.callout .tip}
💡 Pro Tip: At events, you'll meet potential clients like fractional operations companies, editors, investors, and lawyers. The networking opportunities are invaluable!
:::
::: {.callout .warning}
⚠️ Caution: Building a robust client network takes time, but it's worth the effort. Eventually, you'll have the luxury of choosing your clients.

## ☝️ All The Other Tips 

🏢 Setting up a Company

::: {.callout}
In the US, consider an LLC; in Canada, a C-corp. These structures offer legal protection and tax benefits.
⚠️ But remember: Don't get bogged down with this initially. Focus on landing your first client!
:::
💰 Pricing
::: {.callout .tip}

In the beginning, getting paid at all is a win.
As you gain experience, align with industry standards.
Don't underprice your services.

💡 Pro Tip: Ask clients for their budget first to gauge expectations.
:::
::: {.book}
📚 Recommended Read: "Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss
:::
🔍 Prevent Scope Creep
::: {.callout .warning}
Clearly define:

What you will and won't do
Level of post-project support (e.g., tech support)

This clarity makes it easier to maintain boundaries later.
:::
🌟 Reputation Management
::: {.callout}
Remember: Your reputation is everything in freelancing.
🔑 Key Strategy: Underpromise and overdeliver

But they can be very beneficial!\n\n\n\nConsider using platforms if:\n\n🏞️ You have a completely blank portfolio. It’s a good way to start building your portfolio.\n🚀 You have a rare skill that is in high demand (e.g., building AI chatbots).\n💰 You can undercut people’s prices (e.g., building websites like this one using Quarto, which is way faster and cheaper).\n🌍 You’re from a developing country because generally developed country clients pay better than local clients.\n🤝 You just want to expand your network."

    "text": "🐦 Two Birds One Stone: Portfolio and Your First Gig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💼 Portfolio is everything. Doesn’t matter if you already have lots of work experience on your resume.\n\n\n\nThink about these key questions:\n\n🤔 How do I showcase myself and my unfair advantage?\n🎯 Based on the type of work I’m going for, how do I show that I have the skills and experience my potential client would want?\n⏳ Spend a lot of time building your portfolio because that is almost always the first screen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Pro Tip: Change your portfolio projects depending on the specific project you are trying to land. Clients will hire the freelancer with the most relevant experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⚠️ Don’t just do personal projects by yourself!

But they can be very beneficial!\n\n\n\nConsider using platforms if:\n\n🏞️ You have a completely blank portfolio. It’s a good way to start building your portfolio.\n🚀 You have a rare skill that is in high demand (e.g., building AI chatbots).\n💰 You can undercut people’s prices (e.g., building websites like this one using Quarto, which is way faster and cheaper).\n🌍 You’re from a developing country because generally developed country clients pay better than local clients.\n🤝 You just want to expand your network."
